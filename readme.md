A Laravel package for updating your models indirectly using an adjustments table. This allows you to overwrite a model's attributes without changing the model directly. This can be useful in cases where you don't have control over the data flow of your models.

A concrete example of its usefulness is when you feed a table with data from an API, and use a cron job to keep the table updated with the newest data. In this case you might want to keep the table untouched so your changes are not overwritten by newer updates without you realising. Updating the table using an adjuster solves this problem as all adjustments you make to the data are stored in another table.

Most of the functionality lives in a trait, making it easy to use in your models. You can also adjust multiple models using the same adjustments table, as it uses polymorphic relationships. The package is well tested and extremely lightweight.

## Installation

Install the package through Composer:

```shell
composer require mangopixel/laravel-adjuster
```

After updating Composer, append the following service provider to the `providers` key in `config/app.php`:

```php
\Mangopixel\Adjuster\AdjusterServiceProvider::class
```

You may also publish the package configuration file and migrations using the following Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mangopixel\Adjuster\AdjusterServiceProvider"
```

The configuration file is well documented and you may edit it to suit your needs. You may also edit the migration file to your liking. However, make sure you update the `adjustable_column` and `changes_column` values in the configuration if you change the default column names.

## Usage

After installing and adding the service provider, you should migrate the `adjustments` table. If you have published the vendor files as described in the installation guide above you should have the new migration file in the migrations folder. In that case you can just run `php artisan migrate`.

### Changing the migration file

If for some reason the default table name adjustments or any of the default column names don't fit your needs, feel free to change them to whatever suits your needs. Just make sure to update the `adjustments_table`, `adjustable_column` and `changes_column` in the configuration file accordingly.

The migration uses a json field by default. This is only supported in MySql 5.7+, you should however be able to change the field to a text field instead without any repercussions.

### Adding the trait

You need to use the `HasAdjustments` trait for every model you want to be able to adjust. There is also an optional interface `Adjustable` which the trait fulfills. An example model:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Mangopixel\Adjuster\Adjustable;
use Mangopixel\Adjuster\HasAdjustments;

class Fruit extends Model implements Adjustable
{
  use HasAdjustments;
}
```

### Making adjustments

The `HasAdjustments` trait gives you access to multiple methods, among others the adjust method, which you can use to make a new adjustment to the model:

```php
$fruit->adjust( [
    'name' => 'Mango',
    'price' => 100
] );
```

The above will create a new row in the adjustments table linking to the Fruit model through a polymorphic relationship (with `adjustable_id` and `adjustable_type`). The row will also have a JSON column containing the updated name and price.

If a row already exists, however, it will instead merge the new changes with the old ones.

### Removing adjustments

Once an adjustment has been set in the changes JSON, you may remove it again by passing in a null value when adjusting:

```php
$fruit->adjust( [
    'name' => null
] );
```

The above will remove the name adjustment from the JSON column in the `adjustments` table and revert the model's value to its original state. If you remove all changes in the JSON column, the row in the `adjustments` table will disappear entirely.

*The package will listen for updates on the adjustable model and if any of the attributes changes to the same value as the adjusted value the adjustment will automatically be removed.*

### Applying adjustments

If you retrieve the Fruit model from the example above, you will get the original values, and not the adjusted ones. This is because the package gives you the option of when you want to adjust the model, by providing an `applyAdjustments` method:

```php
$fruit->applyAdjustments();
```

This will fill the model's attributes with the values from the `adjustments` tables. It will not persist the new values to the model's table. If you try to save() a model after applying adjustments you will get a `\Mangopixel\Adjuster\ModelAdjustedException` exception. The idea of the package is to not update the model directly, it therefore protects you from ever persisting the changes applied from the adjustments to the database.

### Disable save protection

If you don't want the package to throw an exception when trying to save a model instance where changes from the `adjustments` table has been applied, you may disable the `save_protection` in the configuration file.

If you only want to disable it on individual models you can also add a new property to the model:

```php
protected $saveProtection = false;
```

### Accessing the adjustment model

The package provides an `Adjustment` model for the `adjustments` table. You can access the model relationship using the `adjustment` function from the `HasAdjustment` trait:

```php
$model->adjustment;
```

Which returns the adjustment row relating to the model, if one exists. You also have the opposite relation specified in the `Adjustment` model:

```php
$adjustment->adjustable;
```

This will return the model relating to the adjustment.

### Extending the adjustment model

If you would like to extend the functionality of the `Adjustment` model you may simply create a new model that extends `Mangopixel\Adjuster\Adjustment`. You will also need to update the `adjustment_model` in the configuration file so the package knows which class to use as the model.
